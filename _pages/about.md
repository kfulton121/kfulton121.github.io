I'm an Assistant Professor in the [**Department of Computer Science**](https://cs.mines.edu/) at the [**Colorado School of Mines**](https://www.mines.edu/) where I run the Security and People at Mines (SPAM) lab. I received my PhD from the University of Maryland, where I was advised by [**Michelle Mazurek**](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~mmazurek/) in the [**Security, Privacy, and People Lab (SP2)**](https://sp2.umiacs.io/).

My research exists at the **intersection of people and security and privacy**. The goal of my research is to improve peoples' understandings and implementations of security and privacy by empirically evaluating their experiences and knowledge. Recent research has focused on:
- Improving security and privacy education at the K-12 level
- Exploring the impacts of AI on security and privacy in various capacities (K-12 spaces, software development, study design, etc)
- Improving the adoption of secure tools and programming languages (fuzzers, Rust, etc)

As a result of my work, I aim to provide scientifically-based recommendations for the improvement of secure development, security and privacy education, and the security and privacy considerations of emerging AI technologies.

I am fortunate to work with a number of incredible graduate students:
- Kelly Fisher (CS PhD)
- Jake Hoekstra (CS PhD)
- Jack Kingham (CS PhD)
- Katy Limes (CS PhD)

**I do not currenlty have any openings for PhD students. I have a few openings for excited, motivated undergraduate and Master's students. Prospective students can look at the [prospective students](https://kfulton121.github.io/students/) page for details.**
