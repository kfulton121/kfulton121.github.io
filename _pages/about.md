I'm an Assistant Professor in the [**Department of Computer Science**](https://cs.mines.edu/) at the [**Colorado School of Mines**](https://www.mines.edu/). I did my PhD at the University of Maryland, advised by [**Michelle Mazurek**](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~mmazurek/) in the [**Security, Privacy, and People Lab (SP2)**](https://sp2.umiacs.io/).

My research centers around secure software development, with a focus on **the human factors impacting secure software development**. I'm interested in understanding how software developers and security professionals reason and think about security in their job roles. Specifically, I'd like to explore how current security interventions, tools, programming languages, and organizational processes fail developers and security professionals and how we can improve them. As a result of my work, I aim to provide scientifically-based recommendations for improvements of secure development resources, secure development tools, and secure development processes.

**I have a few openings for excited, motivated students. If you are interested in a PhD, please send me an email describing, specifically what interests you about my research. If you are interested in working with me as an undergrad, please feel free to stop by my office or send me an email. Prospective students can look at the prosepctive student page for details.**
