<h1><span style="color:DarkOliveGreen;">Why do research/go to grad school?</span></h1>
In my opinion, research is one of the most rewarding pursuits. You get to think of difficult questions and then attempt to answer them. You get to employ creative problem solving, and pursue things that get you excited. Research can be incredibly rewarding (and frustrating). 

If research is something that you think you might want to do for a career, grad school is likely a good choice for you.

<h1>Why join the <span style="color:#102e82;">S</span><span style="color:#bf2c34;">P</span><span style="color:#f6d047;">A</span><span style="color:#aaaaaa;">M</span> lab?</h1> 

Other than the super cool name and the even cooler logo (thank you [Gemini Image Generator](https://gemini.google.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=2024enUS_gemfeb&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwzN-vBhAkEiwAYiO7oKUwRF2qfCUd-Lu0yKq0XbAn5v7zx-oevy4lz3BA-LBeP7JKyNclHRoCfb0QAvD_BwE)), there are everal really great reasons to join the my lab. First, I am an early-career faculty member which means that I am very excited to work with students in a hands-on fashion. I have many new and exciting ideas, and I am very happy to work closely with you as we develop them. Second, I work in an incredibly interesting space focusing on both the **human** and **technial factors** impacting **secure software development**. Working with me means getting to **hunt for vulnerabilities** and **understanding how people think**, often in the same project.

Third, Mines is an R1 institution with a unique focus on research and teaching. The CS department is a small, tight-knit community. Finally, Mines is located in the beautiful Golden, CO. If you like doing something oustide, Colorado has a lot to offer. Additionally, there are many incredible concerts ([Red Rocks Ampitheater](https://www.redrocksonline.com/)), breweries, and places to eat.

<h1><span style="color:#A0522D;">For prospective PhD students:</span></h1>
<h2>What can you expect from me?</h2>
As your advisor, you can expect that I will:

- Give you feedback on papers, research protocols, and research ideas.
- Encourage and support you to submit to top-tier security conferences.

<h2>What do I expect from you?</h2>
Working with me, I will expect that you will:
- Come to our regular meetings with todos completed and questions/disicussion points prepared.

If you can't find a solution within a reasonable about of time, I exoect that you will reach out to me asap. I also expect that you will take initiative on projects by pursuing relevant resources, planning next steps, and organizing projects to meet necessary deadlines. Expectations will change as you progress through your PhD. I expect more from senior students than junior students.
